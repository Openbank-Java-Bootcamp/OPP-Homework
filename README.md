### Instructions

Our CRM should allow you to:

- A list of all Leads can be displayed by typing “Show Leads”.
- An individual Lead’s details can be displayed by typing “Lookup Lead id”.
- A Lead can be converted to an Opportunity by typing “convert id”.
- Opportunity status can be edited using the command “close-lost id” or “close-won id”.
